Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 are incredibly powerful — but they have limitations. They don’t “know” your private data, they can hallucinate, and their training data is static. That’s where Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) steps in.

LLMs can’t help unless they’ve seen that document before. But with RAG, you can fetch relevant content (your own data!) and feed it to the model on-the-fly — like giving it a custom memory.

RAG helps you:

Inject up-to-date, domain-specific knowledge
avoid hallucinations from model guesswork
Keep models lightweight while enabling deeper knowledHow LLMs + Context = Better Answers
RAG is the backbone of many AI-powered apps — from PDF Q&A bots and internal search tools to legal assistants and chatbots over private data.
